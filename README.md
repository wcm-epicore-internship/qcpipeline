### Aim
The aim of this project is to compare publicly available software applications and libraries for processing quality control metrics on FASTQ files and from this comparison, develop a software pipeline.
### Background
* What is a FASTQ file? Where does it come from? Who uses them?
* Why do we need quality control? Doesn't the sequencer give quality control?
* Why is QC of Big Data different to QC of say an Excel spreadsheet?
